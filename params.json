{"name":"The Numbers Scrapper","tagline":"","body":"### About\r\nThis project is used to get the movies data freely stored in [The Numbers](http://www.the-numbers.com/). The intention is to easily gather the data for research purpose.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThe main feature is that this can be used to gather the movies data. The data will be stored in SQL Server. You can change that by the way since I only use DBML to manage my data connection.\r\n\r\nAdded feature is that you can export the data to Excel so you can easily print it. If you prefer, you could export it from your DBMS for faster and more precise result with custom queries.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
